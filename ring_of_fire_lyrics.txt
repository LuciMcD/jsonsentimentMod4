Paroles de la chanson Ring of fire par Johnny Cash
Love is a burnin' thing
And it makes a fire ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns

The ring of fire
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Ohhh, but the fire went wild

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher

And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
