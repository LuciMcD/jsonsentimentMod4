Paroles de la chanson Live Like You Were Dying par Tim McGraw
Verse 1

He Said I Was In My Early Forties, With A Lot Of Life Before Me, When A Moment Came That Stop Me On A Dime. I Spent Most Of The Next Days, Looking At The X-Rays. Talking Bout? The Options And Talking Bout? Sweet Time. I Asked Him When It Sank In, That This Might Really Be The Real End, How?s Hit Ya? When You Get That Kind Of News?

Man Whad Ya Do?

And He Said



Chorus

I Went Skydiving

I Went Rocky Mountain Climbing

I Went Two Point Seven Seconds On A Bull Name Fu Man Chu


And I Loved Deeper

And I Spoke Sweeter

And I Gave Forgiveness I?d Been Denyin?

And He Said Some Day I Hope You Get The Chance

To Live Like You Were Dyin



Verse 2

He Said I Was Finally The Husband, But Most The Time I Wasn?t. And I Became A Friend; The Friend Would Like To Have. And All A Sudden Goin? Fishin Wasn't Such An Imposition, And I Went Three Times That Year I Lost My Dad. Well I Finally Read The Good Book, And Took A Good Long Hard Look At What I Would Do If I Could Do It All Again.

And Then



Chorus

I Went Skydiving


I Went Rocky Mountain Climbing

I Went Two Point Seven Seconds On A Bull Name Fu Man Chu

And I Loved Deeper

And I Spoke Sweeter

And I Gave Forgiveness I?d Been Denyin?

And He Said Some Day I Hope You Get The Chance

To Live Like You Were Dyin



Bridge

Like Tomorrow Was A Gift, And Ya Got Eternity To Think About What To Do With It, What Could You Do With It, What Did I Do With It, What Would I Do With It?



Skydiving

I Went Rocky Mountain Climbing

I Went Two Point Seven Seconds On A Bull Named Fu Man Chu


And Man I Loved Deeper

And I Spoke Sweeter

And I Watched An Eagle As It Was Flyin

And He Said Some Day I Hope You Get The Chance

To Live Like You Were Dyin
